# Advanced Selectors

Use your knowledge of advanced CSS selectors to create a pattern or image on the
grid provided. This exercise is meant to help you practice reading the DOM tree
and making accurate and precise selections with CSS.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

    $ cd ~/dev
    $ git clone git@github.com:YWebCA/selectors-exercise.git

All your work goes in `pattern.css`. A checklist of things to try to include has
been provided. You don't have to adhere to it strictly, but do try a variety
of techniques.

## Turning it In

Copy your finished `pattern.css` and name it `yourName.css`. Attach
`yourName.css` to the appropriate card in Trello. We will demo everyone's
exercise in class.

## Tips

Each quadrant is organized differently. Use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect
the DOM.

Feel free to experiment but please do not change the HTML file; the
instructor will provide a clean one for you at the demo (so you can't depend on
your changes).

CSS animation and other shenanigans are allowed.
